# Quickstart

**Prerequisites.** Ensure that you have `node` and `yarn` installed on your
command line.

**Development.** Once you have verified that `node` and `yarn` are installed,
navigate to the root folder of this project and run `yarn install` to install 
the required packages. Then run `yarn live` to compile and start a local
server. Navigate to <http://localhost:8080/> to view.

Main entry point is /src/index.tsx. Play around with it!

**Production.** Run `npm run build:prod` to build a static version of the SPA
to the /docs folder.
